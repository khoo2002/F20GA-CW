This coursework, we decided to create a detailed lamp model with animated and interactive features, ideal for use in an indoor scene.

**Model Components**
The lamp is divided into five main parts:
Chains – Supporting chains that connect to the ceiling.
Lamp Cover – The outer shell surrounding the bulb.
Bulb – The light source, activated by interaction.
Diamond Pendants – Decorative elements hanging below the lamp cover.
Pull-type Light Switch – Used to turn the light on and off.

**Scene Setup**
A simple indoor layout with ceiling and walls.

**Animation Details**
Two main animations are incorporated:
Light Switch Activation – Pulling the light switch turns the bulb on or off.
Swing Movement – Initiating a swing motion from the top chain to create a gentle swaying effect.

**Interactive Features**
The model includes two primary interactions:
Light Switch Control – Dragging the light switch with the mouse will toggle the light on or off.
Lamp Swing – Clicking on one side of the lamp cover will make the lamp swing in that direction.
