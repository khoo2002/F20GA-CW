# F20GA-CW
This coursework, we decided to create a detailed lamp model with animated and interactive features, ideal for use in an indoor scene.

# Model Components
The lamp is divided into five main parts:
1. Chains – Supporting chains that connect to the ceiling.
2. Lamp Cover – The outer shell surrounding the bulb.
3. Bulb – The light source.
4. Diamond Pendants – Decorative elements hanging below the lamp cover.
5. Pull-type Light Switch – Used to turn the light on and off.

# Scene Setup
A simple indoor layout with ceiling and walls.

# Animation Details
Two main animations are incorporated:
1. Light Switch Activation – Pulling the light switch turns the bulb on or off.
2. Swing Movement – Initiating a swing motion from the top chain to create a gentle swaying effect.

# Interactive Features
The model import using WebGPU library which are 
1. WebGPU
2. Three.js

The model includes the following interactive features:

1. **Camera Circular Motion with Button Toggle**  
   The camera moves in a circular motion around the lamp and always looks at it. This motion can be toggled on/off using a button.

2. **Zoom In/Out by Mouse Wheel**  
   Zoom the camera in and out using the mouse wheel, allowing the user to get a closer or farther view of the lamp.

3. **Drag to Rotate Around the Lamp**  
   The camera can be dragged to rotate around the lamp, allowing users to explore the model from different angles.

4. **WASD Keyboard Movement**  
   Use the WASD keys to move the camera forward, backward, left, or right in the 3D space.

5. **Button to Control Light On/Off**  
   A button allows users to toggle the light on and off. The button text updates to reflect the current light status.

6. **Hover Effect on Light Switch**  
   When the pointer hovers over the light switch, a visual cue is provided to indicate that the switch can be interacted with.

7. **Interact with Light Switch**  
   Clicking on the light switch toggles the light on or off and animates the pulling of the switch for a more interactive experience.
