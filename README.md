# F20GA-CW
This coursework, we decided to create a detailed lamp model with animated and interactive features, ideal for use in an indoor scene.

# Model Components
The lamp is divided into five main parts:
1. Chains – Supporting chains that connect to the ceiling.
2. Lamp Cover – The outer shell surrounding the bulb.
3. Bulb – The light source, activated by interaction.
4. Diamond Pendants – Decorative elements hanging below the lamp cover.
Pull-type Light Switch – Used to turn the light on and off.

# Scene Setup
A simple indoor layout with ceiling and walls.

# Animation Details
Two main animations are incorporated:
1. Light Switch Activation – Pulling the light switch turns the bulb on or off.
2. Swing Movement – Initiating a swing motion from the top chain to create a gentle swaying effect.

# Interactive Features
The model includes two primary interactions:
1. Light Switch Control – Dragging the light switch with the mouse will toggle the light on or off.
2. Lamp Swing – Clicking on one side of the lamp cover will make the lamp swing in that direction.
