# Lamp Model in Blender
**The model consists of five main parts:** 
the lamp cover, the bulb, a chain at the top, decorative teardrop-shaped diamond pendants, and a pull-type light switch. Below, we describe the modeling process for each component, material setup, scene arrangement, and final render settings.

## Model Components
- **Lamp Cover**: The lamp cover forms the main structure of the lamp and houses the bulb.
- **Chain**: Positioned at the top of the lamp, the chain provides a hanging structure.
- **Bulb**: Designed with detailed filaments and encased in a glass-like material for realism.
- **Diamond Pendants**: Teardrop-shaped, faceted like diamonds to enhance reflection.
- **Pull-Type Light Switch**: Includes a small square pendant tag and a wire that connects to the cross-shaped bulb holder.

## Modeling Process
1. **Initial Sketch**:
   - Started with a 2D sketch to define the base shape of each component.

2. **Lamp Cover**:
   - Created the base using a simple cylinder, then transformed it in edit mode to achieve the final shape.
   - Applied a translucent 3D shader for a soft, diffused appearance.

3. **Chain**:
   - Modeled using a torus shape, duplicated and rotated by 90 degrees.
   - Used an array modifier to create the full chain.
   - Increased metallic intensity in the material settings for a realistic metal look.

4. **Bulb**:
   - Modeled with intricate filaments to replicate real bulb details.
   - Used a transparent, glass-like material for the outer structure.

5. **Diamond Pendants**:
   - Designed in a teardrop shape with multiple facets to enhance light reflection.
   - Applied a glass-like material to create transparency and reflections.
   - Used an empty object as a reference for rotation and applied a modifier with an object offset to arrange pendants evenly around the lamp cover.

6. **Bulb Holder**:
   - Built in a cross shape to hold the bulb in place securely.

7. **Pull Switch**:
   - Added a black, wood-textured tag in the form of a small square pendant.
   - Connected a wire from the switch to the bulb holder.
   - Applied an image texture to the pendant surface for a refined look.

## Scene Setup
1. **Environment**:
   - Created a simple indoor scene with a box, cutting edges and faces to mimic walls.

2. **Lighting**:
   - Experimented with various light sources to showcase the lamp’s materials and reflections.
   - Set lighting to simulate the “light on” effect for the render.
